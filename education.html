<p><p style="font-family: calibri"><strong style="font-size: 18px"><strong style="color: maroon">My education began on kindergarten. When i was 5 years old. After kindergarten, I entered pre-school when I was 6 years old. When I was in grade 1, I went to primary school at Sk Kamil 3. Then I moved to Sk Kampung Nara which is near my house. Here, I enter many sports activities and other programs. I sat for the UPSR here and passed the exam well.</strong></center>

<p><p style="font-family: calibri"><strong style="font-size: 18px"><strong style="color: maroon">Throughout my high school years, my educational experience had its ups and downs. My first high school is SMA Tengku Amalin Ai'shah Putri. All the students there are female students. I love studying there. I love that school. But when I was in form 2, I had to move because I lived in a hostel. This school is far from my home. But, I need to go to tuition classes. Then I moved to SMK Seri Aman school where my mom teaches there. Since my mom teach there, many teachers and students knew me. I have entered a lot of activities. I am a school prefect. I studied here until I finished SPM and STPM with excellent results. There are many memories that I cannot forget with my friends there. I miss my high school.</strong></center>

	Now, I am in semester 2 in the Bachelor's degree in Office Management at UITM Kelantan. I started studying here by staying in college during semester 1. In college, I met a lot of good friends. Now, I live in a rented house with my classmates. Now, we are getting closer. We both want to chase the dean. I hope we success soon.</strong></center>
